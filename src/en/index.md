## **Chapter 1 — Product Overview**

**Core Value: The Last Line of Defense in Cybersecurity**

SOSI is a high-strength security gateway that integrates identity authentication and remote access auditing. It solves the three biggest pain points enterprises face during remote maintenance operations: "Who can access?", "What can they touch?", and "What did they do after getting in?"



* **Strongest Identity Shield**: Enforces integration with LDAP authentication and site-wide two-factor authentication (2FA) to prevent account compromise.
* **Precise Access Navigation**: Through an administrator-reviewed authorization mechanism, users can only connect to the specific devices required for their role.
* **All-Angle Behavior Recording**: All operations are recorded via session recording and keylogging, and a dynamic watermark is applied, making unauthorized operations traceable.

## **Chapter 2 — Quick Start**


### **I. Setup Flow**

1. Create a User



* **Purpose**: Create operators who can log in to the SOSI system.
* **Action**: On the **User List** page, click **Create User** and set the login account and password.

2. Create a Device



* **Purpose**: Define the remote host to connect to (e.g., Windows or Linux).
* **Action**: On the **Device List** page, add a device, enter the **IP Address**, and select the correct **Type** (RDP, SSH, or VNC).

3. Create a Certificate



* **Purpose**: Store the account credentials for the remote host (the "key" to automatic login).
* **Action**: Under **Certificate Settings**, create a certificate and enter the valid **username and password** for that host.

4. Authorize the Connection



* **Purpose**: Bind the "user, device, and key" together.
* **Action**: Go to **Accessible Device List**, click **Create Accessible Device**, and select the certificate created in Step 3 in the **Certificate** field.


### **II. User Connection Steps**



1. Log in to the SOSI system.
2. Find the target device card in the Device List.
3. Click **Connect**. The system will complete the login automatically and take you directly to the desktop or command-line interface.
4. Close the browser tab to end the connection.




## **Chapter 3 — System Login and Account Security**

\* The system does not provide a public registration portal. Users can only be added via LDAP directory service integration or by manual addition by an administrator.


### **I. Login Instructions**



1. User Account: Enter the User ID
2. Password: Enter the login password
3. Authentication Method:
* Admin: Select **SOSI**
* General User: Select **LDAP**

![Login Screen](/sosi-manual/assets/images/login-2.png){: width="500px"}

### **II. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Setup**

\* Required only if enabled



1. The following screen will appear after logging in.
2. Bind the Authenticator: Download an Authenticator app on your phone (e.g., Google Authenticator) and scan the QR code displayed on the page.

![Two-Factor Authentication](/sosi-manual/assets/images/2FA-3.png){: width="500px"}

3. Enter the Verification Code: Enter the 6-digit one-time passcode generated by the app to complete binding. (Refreshes every 30 seconds.)
4. Backup Recovery Codes: The system will provide multiple recovery codes.

⚠️ **Important**: Be sure to download or screenshot these codes. If you lose your phone or cannot use the authenticator, these are your only login credentials. (Each recovery code can only be used once.)



5. The system will redirect you back to the login screen. You will need to enter the 6-digit verification code again to log in.

![Enter Verification Code](/sosi-manual/assets/images/Verification-code-4.png){: width="500px"}

### **III. Account Lockout and Unlock**



1. Lockout Trigger Conditions
* Failed Password Attempts: If a user enters an incorrect password 5 or more times consecutively, the system will automatically lock the account.
* Lock Consequence: The account will be automatically locked by the system, suspending login access for **1 hour**.

![Password Lockout](/sosi-manual/assets/images/lock-5.png){: width="500px"}

2. How to Unlock

    Administrators can restore a user's account access via the following two methods:

* Manual Unlock by Administrator:
    1. Go to the **User List** page.
    2. Find the locked user and click the **Unlock** button.
    3. This action immediately resets the failed login count and restores login access.
* Automatic System Unlock: The user simply needs to wait for the 1-hour lockout period to expire, after which the system will automatically lift the restriction.
* Function Definition: The Unlock function only resets the failed login count; it does **not** change the existing password.
